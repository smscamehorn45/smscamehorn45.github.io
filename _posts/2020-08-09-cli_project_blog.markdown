This project has been a rollercoaster. I started off wanting to create what I later would find out would be very complicated project by getting list all of the destiny 2 weapons available and found out through research that its not something easily called for in bungies API. I sat around for what seemed like hours trying to come up with a different idea for my project. I then remembered my first blog post talking about what made me interested in software engineering(pokemon Go) I decided to go with a project of a pokedex to call a pokemons name and retrieve their height,weight, type, ability, and moves they could learn. It was a very fun process and learned a lot a long the way(thanks google). I got stuck on one line of code for a very long time when trying to call from the pokemons ability, constantly getting the response from the API of EVERY ability possible in the game. It turned out that all I needed to do was to map and call for the ability value. I learned a lot from the project and feel confident in developing more projects in the future.
