I decided to study software engineering when my girlfriend and I went to an art fair that handed out a pretty useless map. This was around the time that Pok√©mon Go was a huge deal and I had the idea of creating a map application very similar. I imagined that it would show the tents on the map similar to the "pokestops" in the game. I would then try to teach myself through self paced lessons on either YouTube or Udemy but they lacked the structure and support I was looking for. School was also out of the question for me as I was working full-time as a call center manager/backup data anaylyst and could not commit the time needed. Working with data as the backup data analyst really gave me some foresight into formulas and algorithms that I knew would be useful in the future. I then left that job and started to look at software engineering boot camps and found Flat Iron, which is partnered with my current employer "Citi Bank", and it was an easy choice of what camp I wanted to choose.
